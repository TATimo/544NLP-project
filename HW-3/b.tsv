1	Has checked the outlaw's way ; 	b
2	Ah ! my dear father, tell me why ? 	b
3	But what shall brave the deep, deep waves 	b
4	And gives the waves a brighter blue, 	b
5	Stooped, and raised his languid head ; 	b
6	Subdue this quenchless will ! ' 	b
7	He felt for all the beauty there. 	b
8	Turn back, from that tempestuous surge, 	b
9	Before it fades away ! 	b
10	When winter winds were wild . 	b
11	Warm and bright on Arden's lake 	b
12	All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, 	b
13	Who motionless is laid . . . 	b
14	Of southern waters breaking to the wind, 	b
15	And laughter sink into a sigh, 	b
16	Their sunlit isles of paradise, 	b
17	The vain man smile, the fool deride, 	b
18	4 This is my home where whirlwinds blow, 	b
19	1 'd call forth the glorious chorus again 	b
20	With blood on his hand that he wept to have shed ? 	b
21	The space between is all forgot, 	b
22	* But, I '11 not fear, I will not weep 	b
23	Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night ; 	b
24	I have one rite a gentle kiss ; 	b
25	When those who were thy own compeers, 	b
26	All Nature's million mysteries, 	b
27	To reach, at last, the eternal home, 	b
28	Was flitting o'er me evermore. 	b
29	But something whispers to my mind, 	b
30	What though the stars and fair moonlight 	b
31	And who with unregretful eyes 	b
32	But sweet was the slight and spicy smell 	b
33	Opening its ports for me and mine ; 	b
34	Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
35	How still, how happy ! These are words 	b
36	And what is thine that it should prove 	b
37	And fresh winds shook the door ; 	b
38	That I shall greet them ne'er again ! ' 	b
39	Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain ; 	b
40	And conquered good and conquering ill 	b
41	Gladly to see his gory sun 	b
42	Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave- 	b
43	Is human love so true ? 	b
44	The strength of eyesight to restore 	b
45	My monarch died to rule for ever 	b
46	Unawed, the darkness of the grave ? 	b
47	Which wilder visions muster'd to my mind ; 	b
48	Clothe in blood its sovereign's prayer. 	b
49	Hark ! listen to the distant gun 	b
50	Yet vainly flowed the calmer wave 	b
51	None need point the princely victim, 	b
52	* And now, 'mid northern mountains lone 	b
53	Are warring night and day ; 	b
54	From those brown hills, have melted into spring : 	b
55	On the shady side reclined 	b
56	On antique roof and hoary tree, 	b
57	That flush of roseate light, 	b
58	None but me beheld him dying, 	b
59	No ; 'twas not the flowery plain : 	b
60	Has Almadore in battle bled ! 	b
61	The yells, the groans, the frenzied gladness, 	b
62	Their careless young eyes are closed in sleeping ; 	b
63	T' escape from labour's tyrant power 	b
64	November's gusts unheeded call ; 	b
65	Doth he not rather roam ? 	b
66	And glowed both roof and floor ; 	b
67	And not one of all my lays 	b
68	1 Ice has barred the Arctic waters, 	b
69	The future fills me with dismay ; 	b
70	Felt, but unseen, the damp dewdrops fall. 	b
71	From those eternal waves that surge below. 	b
72	Rattled against an old vault's rail. 	b
73	When that grim concave frowned above, 	b
74	A thoughtful spirit taught me soon, 	b
75	There if he can to die alone ? ' 	b
76	When it has worn through many a week 	b
77	Because thy soul is clear ; 	b
78	For ever triumphing : 	b
79	Too truly agonised to weep, 	b
80	Through wind and ocean's roar, 	b
81	The face, all deadly fair, 	b
82	Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire, 	b
83	AH ! why, because the dazzling sun 	b
84	But voiceless silence everywhere. 	b
85	December's sullen time ! 	b
86	Hope soothes me in the griefs I know ; 	b
87	Can rob us of the past. 	b
88	That now I cannot feel ! 	b
89	That Death he took a certain aim, 	b
90	The grave is drear, but they are not there : 	b
91	Away, away, resign thee now 	b
92	How every drift in their glens profound 	b
93	Or bless not me with heaven ! * 	b
94	There is no need of other sound 	b
95	Of youth's delight, when youth is past, 	b
96	Day by day some dreary token 	b
97	But hope is dead for him. 	b
98	She scarcely feels the flow ; 	b
99	Faltering, faint, and ready to die. 	b
100	Begins another voyage nay, they 're gone ; 	b
101	1 see them foaming high ; 	b
102	Before their hearts went wandering wrong, 	b
103	From tracking farther day by day, 	b
104	Day breathes such beauty over earth and sky, 	b
105	Raised on my pillow, to descry 	b
106	And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, 	b
107	And Lord Eldred glancing round, 	b
108	And thou false friend and treacherous guide 	b
109	And never radiant bow could be 	b
110	Drinks tears, instead of dew ; 	b
111	A winter sunset in the west 	b
112	A faithless heart to thee ? 	b
113	And let Thy holy Spirit shine 	b
114	Darken that triumphant eye ! 	b
115	Blood-red, he rose, and, arrow-straight, 	b
116	Where tears and mourning cannot come. 	b
117	That wander down to drink the tide. 	b
118	Enough if storms have bowed his head, 	b
119	Even Memory's voice grew dim ; 	b
120	For round their hearths they'll tell this 	b
121	Yet, loved one, it must be : 	b
122	More drear I cannot be ! 	b
123	Those sad relics scattered round ; 	b
124	The giant sons of Anakim 	b
125	Sweet, how softly sweet it came 	b
126	And all around his youthful brow 	b
127	With alien breezes sadly blent. 	b
128	All her cherished hopes should wane, 	b
129	SWART steed of night, thou hast charged thy last 	b
130	Its face is fair divinely fair ; 	b
131	It will not, cannot rise ; 	b
132	But if that night bring only sleep, 	b
133	Deep in unknown eternity ; 	b
134	How could I seek the empty world again ? 	b
135	My eyes are full of tears, 	b
136	No later light has lightened up my heaven, 	b
137	Where evening closes dark and chill ; 	b
138	The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the 	b
139	Concludes thy musing once again ? 	b
140	' O DAY ! he cannot die 	b
141	To breathe its bliss on me ; 	b
142	Through this false world, their all had 	b
143	The stream in silence sang once more 	b
144	And woke her with a sudden song ; 	b
145	Roderic, for thee shall never rise ! 	b
146	With my consoling tear? 	b
147	To the enduring seas 	b
148	THE ABSENT ONE 	b
149	O then another daybreak 	b
150	And grew in another bed ; 	b
151	1 Oh, for the time when I shall sleep 	b
152	DREAM, where art thou now ? 	b
153	Such tears as I weep it is not so ! 	b
154	And voiceless, soulless, messenger, 	b
155	O gallant horse, hold on thy course ; 	b
156	But still they gave no certain token 	b
157	The captive raised her face ; it was as soft and 	b
158	To the deadliest press of the gathering fight 	b
159	Though not because my heart is tame, 	b
160	' And why should we be glad at all ? 	b
161	Oh, for the day, when I shall rest, 	b
162	Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine ; 	b
163	1 And thou art gone with all thy pride ; 	b
164	They were clothed in savage attire ; 	b
165	For the woe I could not bear 	b
166	Than other love, more true? 	b
167	Must always fade, and always cloy : 	b
168	One long look, that sore reproved me 	b
169	I am thinking of my latest shock, 	b
170	For now might Faith decay. 	b
171	Sit beneath the ancient thorn. 	b
172	And morning's beams will rise as drear. 	b
173	Their happy souls are gone to God I 	b
174	Buried in a hapless tomb. 	b
175	Clouded, even as they would weep. 	b
176	And, while the wide earth echoing rung 	b
177	I ne'er had raised this coward cry 	b
178	To leave our children slaves ! 	b
179	She heard the river's restless wave 	b
180	The vast crowds vanished every one ; 	b
181	And 'mid flowery, smiling plains ; 	b
182	That we may overflow the sky 	b
183	I shall smile when wreaths of snow 	b
184	Till the tufted leaves of the garden bower 	b
185	But not of wail for men ! 	b
186	Ah ! no : with louder sound 	b
187	Gone by as if they 'd never been ; 	b
188	No ; turn towards the western side. 	b
189	Or unreal phantoms of distress ! 	b
190	Her spirit is the unfathomed lake 	b
191	Adoring virtue's distant star. 	b
192	ON a sunny brae alone I lay 	b
193	Wrought up in rain and wailing wind : 	b
194	Youthful he seemed but worn as they 	b
195	THE evening sun was sinking down 	b
196	Exhausted with repinings vain, 	b
197	The grass-grown grave, did lie, 	b
198	Daughter divine ! and could his gaze 	b
199	Where will these bright things be ? 	b
200	The grand remains of ancient state. 	b
201	And, all for listening, never sleep. 	b
202	In all His works displayed. 	b
203	To greet the general glow. 	b
204	With a wild and passing thrill, 	b
205	Are shadowed by her hand at last 	b
206	grant thy prayer ? 	b
207	To wander through the snow. 	b
208	Nor ever let my spirit tire, 	b
209	And while on that reflected face 	b
210	And cold suspicion never rise ; 	b
211	Where thou, and I, and Liberty, 	b
212	Burned within the avenging flame : 	b
213	It is but thought full many a night 	b
214	For them a thousand hopes remain, 	b
215	The evening comes before the noon, 	b
216	With heart as summer sunshine light 	b
217	A wanderer o'er the Atlantic main ; 	b
218	Till sorrow's source were dry, 	b
219	Could that sacrifice have purchased 	b
220	Its green boughs in the breezy sky. 	b
221	And cheek almost as white as death, 	b
222	Was it with the fields of green, 	b
223	Have long forgot their vow ; 	b
224	The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown : 	b
225	The starry halls of Elrington 	b
226	This glorious vision of a grove, 	b
227	New glories o'er the blighted spring, 	b
228	Wild the road, and rough and dreary ; 	b
229	And yet there is or seems at least to be 	b
230	1 Our guests are darkly lodged,' I whisper'd, gazing 	b
231	And only wake with you ! 	b
232	Bowed lowest at thy shrine, 	b
233	The little glittering spirits sung, 	b
234	And every vision of old Afric's shore 	b
235	And my remorse shall die. 	b
236	And sweeter hope, when hope despairs ! 	b
237	When the wearied host of the conqueror lies 	b
238	And the purple violet sweet ; 	b
239	This day on Elmor Hill ! ! ! ' 	b
240	While heaven and earth are whispering me, 	b
241	His own creation's dread despair ! 	b
242	King Julius lifts his impious eye 	b
243	Round her returning sight appear 	b
244	In English fields my limbs were laid, 	b
245	I dreamt one dark and stormy night 	b
246	The spirit sent his dazzling gaze 	b
247	It gathers up thoughts akin to madness, 	b
248	My heart's blood flows to buy the blessing to 	b
249	I was at peace, and drank your beams 	b
250	Might fill with sympathy. 	b
251	To twilight's shade forlorn ? 	b
252	What made her weep, what made her glide 	b
253	A wider sound than mountain wind 	b
254	Yet still steeped in memory's dyes 	b
255	Above me, in that stormless sea, 	b
256	I long to hope that all the woe 	b
257	In summer's pride imbue 	b
258	Then I shall rest, while thou wilt weep. 	b
259	Yet ever in my grateful breast 	b
260	Where thick the leaves are dancing, 	b
261	It was thus I said as her graceful head 	b
262	My mortal flesh you might debar, 	b
263	They gain the rock's steep wall. 	b
264	Ye earthly cares begone ! 	b
265	Or Virtue crouched to Infamy ; 	b
266	For I Ve been consecrate to grief 	b
267	Some were dazzling like the sun ; 	b
268	That struggles in thy breast 	b
269	A murmuring round the wall. 	b
270	My downy couch with silk was hung. 	b
271	And helpless Reason warn in vain ; 	b
272	Glides through the maze of pleasure wild. 	b
273	And Peace, the lethargy of Grief ; 	b
274	And Hope, a phantom of the soul ; 	b
275	He ever held in his arms. 	b
276	LADYBIRD ! ladybird ! fly away home, 	b
277	And trembling yet to hear his name, 	b
278	While nightly stars are burning, 	b
279	While evening pours its silent dew, 	b
280	And will not heaven itself bestow 	b
281	I trust not to thy phantom bliss, 	b
282	'My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and 	b
283	Yet the faint wind comes soothingly 	b
284	Round walls where only you are vigil keeping? 	b
285	To-morrow both shall soar away, 	b
286	Winds sigh as you are sighing, 	b
287	Entreating, till his eyes o'erflowed, 	b
288	Gaze on the wretch recall to mind 	b
289	My spirit should startle their rest and tell, 	b
290	Since misery was such misery. 	b
291	To dungeons where a prisoner lies? 	b
292	PLEAD FOR ME 	b
293	STILL beside that dreary water 	b
294	And now the twilight calm and sweet 	b
295	They stood by mute and pale ; 	b
296	Restored into the Deity.' 	b
297	And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
298	A prayer that would come forth altho' it lingered 	b
299	And twenty years of tyrant pride 	b
300	O'er all the crossing thoughts that overflowed. 	b
301	No, radiant angel, speak and say 	b
302	And it sprung and flourished ; 	b
303	Thou bear'st the dim tie of ceaseless dreams, 	b
304	The earth shone round with a long-lost charm : 	b
305	For Thine own sake, be Thou its guide, 	b
306	It had gathered beauty from sunshine and shower, 	b
307	BETWEEN distress and pleasure 	b
308	Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays, 	b
309	The moor-lark in the air, 	b
310	And saw my offerings on their shrine ; 	b
311	I thought that Gabriel's self had come 	b
312	Weighed beneath a mortal sleep ; 	b
313	So, with a ready heart, I swore 	b
314	To seek their altar-stone no more ; 	b
315	His soul has felt the storm below, 	b
316	Behold him 1 	b
317	And set my spirit free ? 	b
318	He must have once been beautiful, 	b
319	Because we dare not stay to gain 	b
320	Like vultures round their prey. 	b
321	A weak and helpless prey ! 	b
322	How loud the storm sounds round the hall ! 	b
323	My darling pain that wounds and sears, 	b
324	Rude the couch that rests us weary ; 	b
325	Rested from the battle's roar ; 	b
326	As she would seek repose ; 	b
327	Mine eye to meet her eye ; 	b
328	And am I wrong to worship where 	b
329	wind that blows ; 	b
330	Of heavy rain or tempest near. 	b
331	Would part and sunlight shone between, 	b
332	And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
333	* THE evening passes fast away, 	b
334	Lips, that did breathe no murmuring 	b
335	The wild birds raise their brood ; 	b
336	What feelings in thy breast?' 	b
337	One moment, ere I go 	b
338	Of labour hardly done ; 	b
339	A thousand thousand silvery lyres 	b
340	But this world's life has much to dread, 	b
341	What shadow is it 	b
342	Bliss like thine is bought by years 	b
343	'Tis sweet to wander here at night, 	b
344	I 'M happiest now when most away 	b
345	One gleam of her heaven-bright face to see. 	b
346	And Time should Fate condemn ; 	b
347	Which coming death denied ; 	b
348	* Then art thou glad to seek repose ? 	b
349	The bee among the heather bells 	b
350	AND first an hour of mournful musing, 	b
351	And earth looks back so dazzling bright 	b
352	As the dear friend untimely called away ; 	b
353	And call a lovelier Life from Death, 	b
354	I breathed not but to send above 	b
355	That comforts me while thou art here, 	b
356	Palace and temple crown the glade. 	b
357	As one who mourns the dead. 	b
358	Why did the morning dawn to break 	b
359	And would not pass away ! 	b
360	Lament their absence drear ; 	b
361	Over my western beauty's grave, 	b
362	Patriot fathers' bloody tombs ; 	b
363	Would rather fight than rest. ' 	b
364	No ; that tree with branches riven 	b
365	And sleet and frozen gloom ? 	b
366	With my dear comrades young and gay, 	b
367	This very crowd is vacancy ; 	b
368	I chide with my soul I bid it cherish 	b
369	From bleak December's sky ? 	b
370	They deluge my heart like the rain 	b
371	Within its mossy cell. 	b
372	How gloomy grows the night ! Tis Gondal's 	b
373	But God is not like human kind, 	b
374	Shall meet our dearest, when we die ; 	b
375	Buried in moors and mountains wild, 	b
376	Defeat serenely borne, 	b
377	Which but because more broken gleams 	b
378	And visions rise, and change, that kill me with 	b
379	The tiny fountain, churning spray 	b
380	Saved thee from a deadlier thrall. 	b
381	Even where he yearns to be I 	b
382	From the fresh root of Eternity ! 	b
383	And I may sing and muse aloud, 	b
384	Their timid forms to guard from harm ; 	b
385	I love thee, boy, for all divine, 	b
386	From the dark marble to the sky, 	b
387	Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom ; 	b
388	And hush that music's solemn sound, 	b
389	But, within its parent's kindly bosom, 	b
390	My love, altho' the very dead 	b
391	Without the veil between. 	b
392	Can friendship's flower droop for years 	b
393	Will forsake thy memory, 	b
394	All mist and tempest free? 	b
395	And, behold ! with tenfold increase blessing, 	b
396	Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray ; 	b
397	The moonbeams softly shine. 	b
398	For many a week and many a day 	b
399	The waveless ocean of repose. 	b
400	Than Native's heaven can pour. 	b
401	Down through that ocean's gloomy night ; 	b
402	Cruel Death ! The young leaves droop and 	b
403	When flowers were closed and day was o'er 	b
404	No ! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish 	b
405	The thrilling shouts of fighting men, 	b
406	She was cruel in her fear ; 	b
407	Was only sullen there ! 	b
408	If our vessels sailed adverse on life's stormy main. 	b
409	AT CASTLE WOOD 	b
410	But as in fit of peevish woe, 	b
411	'Cumber the spirit that would soar 	b
412	The outward tumult seemed to assuage 	b
413	Out to the park this dreary day, 	b
414	She turns from heaven a tearless eye 	b
415	Even weeping o'er that wretch's woe ; 	b
416	And mingled with a foreign mould. 	b
417	One sign of sympathising woe, 	b
418	A snowy brow in ringlets small, 	b
419	Till at last, all old links broken, 	b
420	Vain as thou wert, and weak as vain, 	b
421	Make answer far and near. 	b
422	And this is just the joyous hour 	b
423	Thy soul is powerless over mine.' 	b
424	She would not, in her tranquil sleep, 	b
425	She thought when that confession crossed 	b
426	Do I despise the timid deer, 	b
427	Chain and bar and dungeon wall 	b
428	And heaven itself, so pure and blest, 	b
429	And still entreated him to stay. 	b
430	And he was once an ardent boy ; 	b
431	I saw His wisdom and His power 	b
432	And nothing in the twilight sky 	b
433	How can I rouse my sinking soul 	b
434	Say, ' Earth, lie lightly on that breast, 	b
435	Tortured Gondal's liberty ! 	b
436	The wind blew from the sea. 	b
437	But the joy of life was flown 	b
438	And every window glistens bright 	b
439	With leaves of frozen dew. 	b
440	O look again, for still on high 	b
441	And lights your room like day ; 	b
442	Bright be thine eyes, undimmed their dazzling 	b
443	We thought, t When winter comes again. 	b
444	Ere I would call its glories mine ; 	b
445	Its root has felt a worm, 	b
446	Why dost thou repeat again 	b
447	Till those dark orbs o'erflowing fast 	b
448	4 Listen ! I Ve known a burning heart, 	b
449	' Edward, awake, awake 	b
450	And every time its measured call 	b
451	A thousand forms, a fearful gloom ; 	b
452	Or gleams the sun amongst the mists of care? 	b
453	' When tempests roar on the lonely shore 	b
454	The aimless, heedless carelessness 	b
455	His red heart's blood drenched my dagger ; 	b
456	The music of the Sabbath bell. 	b
457	The sunshine of a summer's sun 	b
458	My cold heart, underneath my hand, 	b
459	Or wakes the breeze in the swaying trees 	b
460	THE day is done, the winter sun 	b
461	The heart is dead in infancy, 	b
462	To hide the streaming tear. 	b
463	Nor marked how from his own young 	b
464	To-morrow, Scorn will blight my name, 	b
465	Thus poured she in that cavern wild 	b
466	Will load me with a coward's shame 	b
467	'Twas thus I thought, an hour ago, 	b
468	And at each belt a weapon dire, 	b
469	Too heavenly now, but doomed to be, 	b
470	I cannot find a haven. 	b
471	When thy heart bounds ardently, 	b
472	His followers went out with Jubilee, 	b
473	Their dust is mingled with the sod, 	b
474	Should cause such bitter woe? 	b
475	Sad thoughts rose in my mind. 	b
476	For, who forgives the accursed crime 	b
477	The violet's eye might shyly flash, 	b
478	OH, thy bright eyes must answer now, 	b
479	Thy presence waked a thrilling tone 	b
480	Where can the weary lay his head, 	b
481	There have been times when this was drear, 	b
482	But, traitor, traitor, from that word 	b
483	All true breasts shrink away ! 	b
484	The spirit above my couch was bending. 	b
485	A slave, because I rule thee still ; 	b
486	As I can hear the ocean's fall 	b
487	My honour's name to spare ! 	b
488	And earth seemed such an alien home 	b
489	* What seek you now on this bleak moor brow, 	b
490	A sound of music reached my ear : 	b
491	And there you pass, in happy dreams, 	b
492	Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 	b
493	Into hopeless, endless mourning. 	b
494	All those disturbed waves decrease 	b
495	Stern duty stores for me. 	b
496	Every leaf speaks bliss to me, 	b
497	That thou didst visit me? 	b
498	Though it roar in thunder wild, 	b
499	Tears have left ghastly traces there, 	b
500	I AM the only being whose doom 	b
501	And doubly will the dark world grieve me, 	b
502	Fast asleep and almost dying, 	b
503	Are brushing off the scented dew, 	b
504	Must always end in gloom ; 	b
505	Midnight moonlight's holy shrine. 	b
506	It closes with a tomb ! 	b
507	From thought of grief are free. 	b
508	Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie, 	b
509	Weary to watch the spirit languish 	b
510	Through years of dead despair. 	b
511	So, if a tear, when thou art dying, 	b
512	Since I beheld another dwelling. 	b
513	When I am not, and none beside, 	b
514	For wild those gusts, and well their chimes 	b
515	That cold departure pictures mine. 	b
516	My deadliest pains might die ; 	b
517	False she was, and unrelenting ; 	b
518	Seems it not that eve's declining 	b
519	Of dastard treachery ? 	b
520	Though comet-like its course was run ; 	b
521	As wise, to mourn the seed which grew 	b
522	Upon her dying mind, 	b
523	Its gentle ray cannot control 	b
524	It comes at last to cancel time, 	b
525	Which since this morn laid many low ; 	b
526	Around me, wretches uttering praise, 	b
527	Or howling o'er their hopeless days, 	b
528	It breathed from its heart invisible. 	b
529	A brotherhood of misery, 	b
530	That it quenches e'en now the vital spark, 	b
531	Whose madness daily maddened me, 	b
532	Arouse thee from thy dreams I 	b
533	Escape earth's dungeon tomb ? 	b
534	But only give me back my tears, 	b
535	What seems the vilest, even like thine 	b
536	As if to invite the smiling skies ; 	b
537	Of seraph's song, and demon's moan ; 	b
538	In concord with her reddening cheek. 	b
539	As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering un- 	b
540	And far away in woody dell 	b
541	I stole away from crowds and light 	b
542	There like a wild beast turns he back, 	b
543	Lavished glory on that second May ! 	b
544	The mortal strife that then befell ; 	b
545	And yet a little longer speak, 	b
546	4 Yet moved she not ; she only raised 	b
547	An earnest grief a strong desire 	b
548	The city's murmur softly blends 	b
549	That we must long till life be done ; 	b
550	As thick as morning's tears ; 	b
551	That heaven which my sweet lover's brow 	b
552	His frequent sighs, long-drawn and deep, 	b
553	And Love I laugh to scorn ; 	b
554	Could I have seen my country smile ? 	b
555	A hundred fights for them ! 	b
556	Little moss-rose, cease to weep, 	b
557	Their cruel strife may close ; 	b
558	Will tread its labyrinths alone. 	b
559	Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me 	b
560	Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 	b
561	'Tis all that I implore ; 	b
562	In life and death a chainless soul, 	b
563	And oh ! above the best of those 	b
564	If ranks beneath the cannon fall, 	b
565	I repent not that which my hand has done 	b
566	And I can sing and I can smile, 	b
567	Alike, while I have holiday. 	b
568	Where wilt thou go, my harassed heart 	b
569	To aid a spirit lost in crime, 	b
570	What spot, or near or far apart, 	b
571	Lights me till my life is done ; 	b
572	There is a spot, 'mid barren hills, 	b
573	And high its arched windows rise, 	b
574	The last full cup of triumph drink, 	b
575	Nor yet the ocean's wave. 	b
576	Bring good in rising, leave peace in decline, 	b
577	Sighed at first, but sighed not long ; 	b
578	Grows as green in April rain, 	b
579	One glance revealed how little care 	b
580	The mute bird sitting on the stone, 	b
581	I was not tired, my darling one, 	b
582	I saw to-day my enemy. 	b
583	For ever present to my eye, 	b
584	My worn heart throbs so wildly 	b
585	The alien firelight died away ; 	b
586	And seen in mist and moonlit stone, 	b
587	I am speaking of a later stroke, 	b
588	But mine sank sad and low ! 	b
589	And all do homage to their will, 	b
590	A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain 	b
591	And when I laughed they all replied ; 	b
592	'Till the dread burst breaks forth once more 	b
593	So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air ; 	b
594	And as blithely as of yore 	b
595	When the pen that motto drew. 	b
596	But long lies the dew on its crimson leaves, 	b
597	Up rose he, and stretched forth his hand, 	b
598	And revelled in my changeful dreams, 	b
599	Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep. 	b
600	Of each dark night and dim, beclouded day. 	b
601	I gazed within thine earnest eyes 	b
602	Brought to earth the fluttering game : 	b
603	Restraint and heavy task recoil. 	b
604	The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more 	b
605	Who spend too soon their youthful day. 	b
606	The common paths that others run ; 	b
607	That centre all the joys of years. 	b
608	That waves in summer air : 	b
609	Wears not a cloud that speaks of gloom. 	b
610	To soothe my spirit's care. 	b
611	From morning's faintest dawning 	b
612	Begilt with tasselled cords of gold, 	b
613	Wilt thou prove faithless now ? 	b
614	I 'd fling the brand in the hissing sea, 	b
615	So often to the unopened door? 	b
616	Have sought one gleam of mercy there ! 	b
617	Across the mountain stream. 	b
618	A few years of captivity, 	b
619	And ice upon the glancing stream 	b
620	You 've tracked me to a lonely spot. 	b
621	Earth's wilderness was round me spread, 	b
622	And night obscure his way ; 	b
623	Mysterious it rose from the billowy moor. 	b
624	Because they have no stay but thine. 	b
625	With thunder volleys rolling on before 	b
626	The sting of anguish drear/ 	b
627	Re-echo back again. 	b
628	'Tis better far away ; 	b
629	They who have been our life, our soul, 	b
630	Geraldine, wilt thou delay? 	b
631	For, oh ! when chill the sunbeams fall 	b
632	My soul, another love. 	b
633	Following the bend of Aspin's side, 	b
634	But, if there be a God above, 	b
635	The whole devoured and lost in death ! 	b
636	Ere evening far away. 	b
637	I could think in the withered grass 	b
638	The loving spirit lingers long, 	b
639	I turned me from that young saint's bed 	b
640	Through th' autumnal sky ; 	b
641	I watch this cloudy evening fall, 	b
642	For whom his spirit unforgiven 	b
643	Sweet voices in the halls resound, 	b
644	Did my exiled spirit grieve. 	b
645	O no, it was not this ! 	b
646	'Tis the last line of the woeful song ; 	b
647	My tortured limbs in dungeons bind, 	b
648	' It was spring, and the skylark was singing * ; 	b
649	With a solemn, plaintive sound. 	b
650	And waken unavailing tears. 	b
651	Nor absence, nor distance can quell. 	b
652	And lonely I am pining, 	b
653	They uttered the music of May ; 	b
654	Far less when evening's pensive hour 	b
655	To that deep and swelling river 	b
656	While thy heart suffers there. 	b
657	And there were garments spread, 	b
658	No ten can deal such deadly misery 	b
659	To walk by the hill-torrent's side ! 	b
660	It is swelled with the first snowy weather ; 	b
661	The rocks they are icy and hoar, 	b
662	Arthur, brother, we returned 	b
663	Fierce grew Rosina's gloomy gaze ; 	b
664	There are no yellow stars on the mountain ; 	b
665	'Tis here 'tis there, 'tis nowhere oh ! my soul, 	b
666	Gaze not so earnestly upon 	b
667	Leagues on leagues are left behind 	b
668	But lovelier than corn-fields all waving 	b
669	All thy cold and scornful pride, 	b
670	My spirit drank a mingled tone, 	b
671	I would have dreary weather, 	b
672	'Tis thus that human minds will turn, 	b
673	And envied such despair. 	b
674	I paused, confounded and distracted, 	b
675	A lip of cruel scorn ; 	b
676	To where those signal lights are burning, 	b
677	And swift were the wings to our feet given, 	b
678	Their brows are unshadowed, undimmed by woe. 	b
679	What sudden power the fancy hath 	b
680	That vision of a mighty host 	b
681	And this shall be my dream to-night ; 	b
682	I shall be a dream to thee. 	b
683	For the moors, where the linnet was trilling 	b
684	My present entity ! 	b
685	Within itself may tell ! 	b
686	And fair it budded day by day 	b
687	His features in the wave. 	b
688	Yawned in the city's reeling wall, 	b
689	On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling, 	b
690	In my Redeemer's name 	b
691	And proud its mighty columns show 	b
692	It feels no sympathy 	b
693	I hurried down the dark oak stair ; 	b
694	When I was hardly six years old, 	b
695	But not the loved music, whose waking 	b
696	No fear of grief in her bright eyes should quiver ; 	b
697	In frozen mist arrayed. 	b
698	Sweet land of light ! Thy children fair 	b
699	A mutual immortality. 	b
700	And sprang up to a glorious birth 	b
701	Needst thou then dissemble sorrow, 	b
702	Those tears had been heaven to me. 	b
703	Well well ; the sad minutes are moving, 	b
704	Though loaded with trouble and pain ; 	b
705	And some time the loved and the loving 	b
706	Shall meet on the mountains again I 	b
707	How could I ask for pitying love, 	b
708	Thus to the man of sin he spoke : 	b
709	ward votary, and to recall within his influence the proud mind 	b
710	And murmur, summer-streams 	b
711	Some nameless thing which hid not grace, 	b
712	She strikes it off with little care ; 	b
713	Shall nature cease to bow ? 	b
714	From such a lethargy ? 	b
715	Whose streets stretch round so ceaselessly. 	b
716	O do not think that God can leave, 	b
717	Subdued both grief and passion wild. 	b
718	Loud was the sudden gust of woe 	b
719	A burdened heart I bear, 	b
720	' Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, 	b
721	This shadow should night's welcome be ; 	b
722	When wounded he wins to the darkest wood, 	b
723	Sinks from the summer sky, 	b
724	To watch through all eternity, 	b
725	And then a captive's tomb. 	b
726	My ear drank his dying sigh. 	b
727	But check those coward sobs, and bring 	b
728	And keep it still divine 	b
729	Though burning thoughts that spurn control, 	b
730	That thy dear blood was poured in vain.' 	b
731	Then art thou not my golden June, 	b
732	Yet few would ask a heaven 	b
733	More like this earth than thine. 	b
734	Then let my winds caress thee ; 	b
735	But what will winter bring? 	b
736	Must first be utterly forgot. 	b
737	And earthly change from pain to pain, 	b
738	HERE again is the same mind in converse with a like 	b
739	Rank, beauty, wealth, and power combine 	b
740	Halos ! O far too bright to shine 	b
741	The opening sea seemed smooth at last ; 	b
742	A cloudless moon shone through 	b
743	* Nay, rather, Gondal's shaken throne 	b
744	* Douglas, he pleaded bitterly, 	b
745	I need not sink beneath my woes ; 	b
746	And yet, through every magic change, 	b
747	The young and aged tree, 	b
748	Her forehead, drooped like lily pale. 	b
749	I needed not its breathing 	b
750	Her children are rank and her kingdom's spread far. 	b
751	For him no tear his stern eye shed 	b
752	How dark the woods will be ! 	b
753	4 The thick leaves in my murmur 	b
754	It breaks upon the awful roar 	b
755	The time of grace is past, 	b
756	' Well, since it must be told, Lady, 	b
757	Thy perished faith shall spring to life, 	b
758	The ringlets of his long black hair 	b
759	Over the Eden of his soul ; 	b
760	Love, and its own life, had power to keep it 	b
761	All round the hot and glaring sky 	b
762	That dearest boon was given ; 	b
763	In their own course to flow.' 	b
764	Evince my gratitude ! 	b
765	Oh no ; these brighter visions vast 	b
766	IN MEMORY OF 	b
767	' 1 '11 win thee 'gainst thy will. 	b
768	Ere his quivering limbs, all foam-flecked, 	b
769	They say, ' Zalona celebrates 	b
770	For Nature's sad reality, 	b
771	And on its green bank, bathed in gore, 	b
772	Have slaves subdued the free? 	b
773	Beneath the church-aisle stone, 	b
774	And Truth may rudely trample down 	b
775	And thou for being alone.' 	b
776	lut dreary, strange, and pale and cold. 	b
777	It tumbled in an inky sea. 	b
778	which it is stayed. 	b
779	' AYE there it is ! it wakes to-night 	b
780	Deep feelings I thought dead ; 	b
781	That lulling monotone did sing 	b
782	To cover deeds untrue, 	b
783	My lonely years had known. 	b
784	And by thine eyes' full gaze, 	b
785	And by the words thou scarce dost speak, 	b
786	The anguish in my breast, 	b
787	Besides the mist is half withdrawn, 	b
788	The moon of summer pours 	b
789	I weary for that land divine, 	b
790	O'er each familiar tower. 	b
791	1 It is hope's spell that glorifies, 	b
792	That welled from mortal grief, I knew 	b
793	I HAVE gone backward in the work, 	b
794	The whisper of its fall : 	b
795	But those were in the early glow 	b
796	From thine own influence free ; 	b
797	That clay he feels will not for ever 	b
798	Come, leave thy dwelling dark and cold, 	b
799	1 Thus truly, when that breast is cold, 	b
800	Thy prisoned soul shall rise ; 	b
801	The dungeon mingle with the mould 	b
802	Dire region of most mighty woe, 	b
803	And is her mirror broke at last 	b
804	Quietly fed in grassy dells ; 	b
805	One glimpse of that unearthly form 	b
806	It treads a forest wide, 	b
807	The ardent, and the happy breast, 	b
808	The sullen clouds lay all unbroken 	b
809	And though its wind repining grieved, 	b
810	For ever on my heart ! 	b
811	The holly is dark when the rose-brier blooms, 	b
812	Hopes quenched, and rising thoughts subdued, 	b
813	* And hope can hardly deck the cheek 	b
814	And in the zenith of his fame 	b
815	And just like his its ringlets bright, 	b
816	Oppressive mystery hung ; 	b
817	Though wasted sore with sorrow, 	b
818	What do these brazen tongues proclaim ? 	b
819	One task alone remains thy pictured face to view, 	b
820	THE ELDER'S REBUKE 	b
821	For nothing nearer paradise 	b
822	Yes, by the tears I Ve poured, 	b
823	Kneeling on the blood-stained heath 	b
824	Watch life's bubbles float away : 	b
825	To rouse its flickering radiance higher ; 	b
826	Comes on the increasing roar ! 	b
827	Oh, in the days of ardent youth 	b
828	Their dark, their deadly ray would more than 	b
829	Where that perished sapling used to be ; 	b
830	Remembrance of his early home 	b
831	Pondered and approved at last : 	b
832	Thank the power that banished thee ; 	b
833	* Glorious is the prize of Duty, 	b
834	Are quenched in morning dull and grey? 	b
835	Thy comrades to the camp retire ; 	b
836	Rests such a shade of deep despair, 	b
837	Youth's early sunshine was poured on his 	b
838	She sat without the grated den, 	b
839	A winter's night. 	b
840	Heedless feet to gulfs of crime. 	b
841	For those whose bodies rest in sleep, 	b
842	That from which it sprung Eternity. 	b
843	When stealing on to lady's bower, 	b
844	With looks and smiles divine ! 	b
845	Far down from heaven its silver flood 	b
846	That wherever I wander, my heart is with thee. 	b
847	4 The lays I love so well.' 	b
848	Virtue is not won by fears.' 	b
849	Thoughts shut within the silent tomb, 	b
850	So would I fearful vigil keep, 	b
851	To send to hell my mortal foe. 	b
852	Walked by the lightsome touch of pleasure : 	b
853	Had he ne'er met a gentler teacher, 	b
854	I saw the burning sunshine fall, 	b
855	In his most burning mood ; 	b
856	Heavy and dull as lead. 	b
857	Might haply dawn above ; 	b
858	Brenzaida's crest is down ; 	b
859	To leave its clay a little while, 	b
860	Can take the bliss that has been given, 	b
861	True to myself, and true to all, 	b
862	It was not hope that wrecked at once 	b
863	That never would cloud the world of day. 	b
864	The cold corpse from its funeral pall, 	b
865	A glorious child again ; 	b
866	And draw his tired gaze from futurity ? 	b
867	And black the piles of rain-clouds lour 	b
868	That glory-shedding star shall glow 	b
869	Where sinless sunshine lay : 	b
870	So softly evening blends with night, 	b
871	And seek a rough and lonely way ; 	b
872	First melted off the hope of youth, 	b
873	Nor mirth, nor music wakes my halls. 	b
874	They whispered nought, but, ' Lady, sleep, 	b
875	When it bears my slumbering child. 	b
876	Strikes the strings resistlesslyt 	b
877	The deep-down sea with sudden sound 	b
878	Calm this resentful mood ; 	b
879	Darkening all my summer skies, 	b
880	For well he knew what dangers frowned, 	b
881	All full of God thy features shine. 	b
882	The glad birds carolled clear ; 	b
883	Between his port and him. 	b
884	My name is on a million tongues, 	b
885	And nothing but that agony 	b
886	In daisied lawns sleep peacefully, 	b
887	And solemn, soothing, softened airs, 	b
888	* Others have been thou mayst be there. ' 	b
889	Incline thee to my changeful will, 	b
890	Thank the power that made thee part 	b
891	Because I could not save. 	b
892	It recks not now, when all is over : 	b
893	The woodland park around it spread, 	b
894	A mourner still, though friend and lover 	b
895	And there it lightens ! Dashed with gore 	b
896	We would not leave our nature home 	b
897	As if through all the 'wildering maze 	b
898	Time parts the heart of men. 	b
899	' Dearest, ever deem me true ' ; 	b
900	And makes the shout of victory 	b
901	Remoter still am I from Thee j 	b
902	And on a strange road journeyed on, 	b
903	might my eyes with tears run o'er ! 	b
904	And makes me strong to undergo 	b
905	But cold cold is that resting-place, 	b
906	Saw those tokens on the ground. 	b
907	And dear to me, aye doubly dear, 	b
908	O'er bower and trees that orb divine 	b
909	Thy eternal Justice found ! 	b
910	And sworn friends fall from me : 	b
911	A memory whose blighting beam 	b
912	The fate was cruel which bore 	b
913	To see her cheek's returning glow ; 	b
914	I saw her stand in the gallery long, 	b
915	Sleep on ; Heaven laughs above, 	b
916	A noble victory you shall sing 	b
917	He almost deemed, might have throbbed again 	b
918	Part human company ; 	b
919	And render up life's tiresome load. 	b
920	That by the death of my dearest treasures 	b
921	Through the wan autumnal sky ; 	b
922	I saw his hoof-prints mark the rock, 	b
923	But this shall be the only time 	b
924	I can tear my soul from its mould of clay, 	b
925	Hush its whispers in your breast ; 	b
926	1 should be where I wish to be. 	b
927	Crushed helpless into earth and Dust ! 	b
928	Full many an eye watched over me, 	b
929	Does sudden silence chill the room ? 	b
930	My whole heart centred there ; 	b
931	If you forget the sacred vows 	b
932	Then let me not despair ; 	b
933	Such as their lips could only pour, 	b
934	Beneath whose noble dome 	b
935	Have anchored safe, and rest at last 	b
936	His dark, keen eyes on Percy gaze 	b
937	Gone ! 'tis a word which through life's troubled 	b
938	Say how long my sleep has been ? 	b
939	Has warmed and blest me long : 	b
940	Would bring its after-storm of pain. 	b
941	Shall set my spirit free, 	b
942	And nerved, like mine, to kill ; 	b
943	The elm-tree by the haunted well 	b
944	THE LADY TO HER GUITAR 	b
945	And green light slept on the happy earth, 	b
946	I know our souls are all divine, 	b
947	To wander far away ; 	b
948	It is stilled above the slain. 	b
949	Sighing, mourning ever more. 	b
950	And his fiery heart aroused panting. 	b
951	Nor hurt thy soul eternally. 	b
952	Resounded far and near : 	b
953	These ceaseless tears ! I wish their flow 	b
954	This voice, though never heard before, 	b
955	How little fraught with real ill, 	b
956	And we together sadly sank 	b
957	The earth as golden, green, and fair, 	b
958	What joyous fete begun, 	b
959	And cheerfully go out to play. 	b
960	HEAVY hangs the rain-drop 	b
961	Pours black reproach on^me : 	b
962	Exhaust thy life and hold thee here. 	b
963	The reckless man would pray ; 	b
964	Of his unquenched, unclouded blaze, 	b
965	* Her heart is beating,' Lesley said, 	b
966	And heavy throbs the young heart 	b
967	And then I go to prove if God, at least, be true ! 	b
968	O'er wood and wold o'er flood and fell, 	b
969	The choking sob, the tortured moan. 	b
970	I need not yield to care, 	b
971	So lost that not a gleam may come. 	b
972	Frowning on the infant, 	b
973	Whose windows looked on the minster-yard, 	b
974	A bleak November's calm. 	b
975	That melancholy boy. 	b
976	GODS of the old mythology 	b
977	The stranger would not turn away, 	b
978	Long ere the poison-tainted air 	b
979	Chasing angry thought away. 	b
980	Where thou dost stand an hour ago, 	b
981	A deeper cup of bitterer pain ; 	b
982	On golden summer's forests green, 	b
983	'Twas grief enough to think mankind 	b
984	It might not be so drear, 	b
985	Has never wooed to blow, 	b
986	Scentless are thy petals, 	b
987	Can watch the lustre leave its skies 	b
988	The cannon with unceasing crash 	b
989	Not one voice sobs * farewell ' ; 	b
990	Barren is thy beauty, 	b
991	So heaven's sun shines in thee. 	b
992	Forget, forsake, refuse to hear ! 	b
993	You both were vainly given : 	b
994	I saw the light decay. 	b
995	YET o'er his face a solemn light 	b
996	Stanzas 5 and 6 have been crossed out in the manuscript. 	b
997	From trampling on thy buried breast. 	b
998	And bounding down the marble stair. 	b
999	That none can pass again. 	b
1000	His banners all bravely flying ; 	b
1001	And cheered his host by adding stern 	b
1002	Why, Seraph, has thine erring wing 	b
1003	Wafted thee down to weep with him ? 	b
1004	IT *s over now ; I Ve known it all ; 	b
1005	Nor do I come to mingle tears ; 	b
1006	But sweet is day, though with shadows 	b
1007	To feel the frost-wind blow ! 	b
1008	Yet the grass before the door 	b
1009	But never more look up and see 	b
1010	Her darling child from her embrace 	b
1011	Will then like virtues shine ; 	b
1012	* Heavy and dark the night is closing ; 	b
1013	Heavy and dark may its bidding be : 	b
1014	May I never tread the hills again. 	b
1015	Or how in exile misery 	b
1016	' Watch in love by a fevered pillow, 	b
1017	When heaven repels my prayer, 	b
1018	Safe as the petrel on tossing billow, 	b
1019	Like summer's sunshine o'er a hill, 	b
1020	( Guardian-angel he lacks no longer ; 	b
1021	From his last hopeless agony, 	b
1022	Eclipsed the glory of the sky, 	b
1023	And my love is truer than angel-care.' 	b
1024	And all the joyous music breathing by, 	b
1025	The place, the hour the same ; 	b
1026	How canst thou linger now ? 	b
1027	And stars were in the depth of blue, 	b
1028	'Tis true she stands among the crowd, 	b
1029	Even so, Guitar, thy magic tone 	b
1030	The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot 	b
1031	And wept above thy fate the more 	b
1032	Flung streaks of moonshine here and there. 	b
1033	Your eyelids droop, a weight is on your brow ; 	b
1034	Woe to the gifted, crime to the giver, 	b
1035	And singing birds and sighing trees, 	b
1036	And dim the hearts that slowly die. 	b
1037	Spent in her Eden Isle 	b
1038	Passed with the ray whose shine it caught ; 	b
1039	What loves me, no word of mine shall e'er betray, 	b
1040	When, severed wide by guiltless gore, 	b
1041	And all their myriad voices 	b
1042	I heard it then, you heard it too, 	b
1043	He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me ; 	b
1044	Strange Power ! I trust thy might ; trust thou my 	b
1045	Looks from its golden frame ; 	b
1046	And that wide west has waked a word 	b
1047	But listen ! The earth is our campaign of war, 	b
1048	Whose sombre portal hides the light, 	b
1049	Clings Percy's wounded spirit so : 	b
1050	I shall not tread again the deep glens where it 	b
1051	The narrow dungeon of the dead, 	b
1052	A silence settled on the room, 	b
1053	Across the waters of despair 	b
1054	And quench the lamp and stir the fire, 	b
1055	Nor, through long hours of future pain, 	b
1056	Her kind face o'er thee shine ? 	b
1057	Have wrapt the parent orb away. 	b
1058	And give me liberty ! ' 	b
1059	Greets no returning summer skies ; 	b
1060	But yet faint not, mournful man ; 	b
1061	And from that world of heavenly light 	b
1062	To guide us in our lifetime's night, 	b
1063	Drowsy and dark my spirit lies, 	b
1064	But, ere night darkened down 	b
1065	Thou wert so bright and fair, 	b
1066	Yet could I with past pleasures 	b
1067	With blue and ghostly gleams, 	b
1068	Remorse even now may wake within 	b
1069	' Well there is rest there, 	b
1070	For there are angels weeping ; 	b
1071	The streets are crowded all, 	b
1072	Our children felt their fathers' wretchedness ; 	b
1073	Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear ; 	b
1074	And curb my own wild will. 	b
1075	True heart and brow unmarked by time, 	b
1076	The law that bade it not defy. 	b
1077	And called on Heaven to aid 	b
1078	With such a fervent zeal, 	b
1079	The clouded forms of long-past history. 	b
1080	It always walks with head declined, 	b
1081	It vexes me to choose another guide : 	b
1082	Their breasts have burst through the battle's 	b
1083	Their ghostly fingers flecked with snow, 	b
1084	What have those lonely mountains worth reveal- 	b
1085	But a wild bird sprang from his hidden lair, 	b
1086	The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling 	b
1087	Though time should change my youthful face, 	b
1088	THE following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote. 	b
1089	No coward soul is mine, 	b
1090	AND like myself lone, wholly lone, 	b
1091	I see Heaven's glories shine, 	b
1092	He hears the stream its waters fling ; 	b
1093	I 'M standing in the forest now, 	b
1094	Almighty, ever-present Deity ! 	b
1095	But a brave heart, with a tarnished name, 	b
1096	The splendour of the main, 	b
1097	They did not dare to smile. 	b
1098	That move men's hearts : unutterably vain ; 	b
1099	With windows yawning on intenser gloom, 	b
1100	When thy stream was troubled, did mine calmly 	b
1101	The wind blew fresh and free. 	b
1102	And forms and faces lost for ever 	b
1103	A thousand dreams of mind. 	b
1104	The steadfast rock of immortality. 	b
1105	Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, 	b
1106	MILD the mist upon the hill, 	b
1107	Pervades and broods above, 	b
1108	Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. 	b
1109	Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh ; 	b
1110	They kindled the perishing ember 	b
1111	And Thou were left alone, 	b
1112	That love, which will the wicked greet 	b
1113	The oath within that caverned hall, 	b
1114	And from the midst of cheerless gloom, 	b
1115	One calm hour on the brink of life 	b
1116	With thy mind's vision pierce the deep, 	b
1117	Eternal midnight there. 	b
1118	OPPRESSED with sin and woe, 	b
1119	And madness cannot feel thy scorn, 	b
1120	I longed to view that bliss divine 	b
1121	And often when the sun declines 	b
1122	The ghastly night, the ghastlier morrow, 	b
1123	Her wavy hair on her shoulders bare, 	b
1124	The burning tears that would keep welling, 	b
1125	That stains our standard green ? 	b
1126	Living in the depth of Heaven ; 	b
1127	As if each gasp were life expelling, 	b
1128	Like sudden ghosts, to memory came 	b
1129	'Tis nothing to eternity : 	b
1130	Mighty heaven, a glad avenger 	b
1131	Death comes on every wind. 	b
1132	That would not mourn the dead. 	b
1133	Thickening above me evermore. 	b
1134	Has neared its final close, 	b
1135	No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn ; 	b
1136	But mutely trace its airy way, 	b
1137	At last refused to mourn. 	b
1138	And summer days again begin 	b
1139	Changing, and still the same, yet swiftly passing. 	b
1140	The wild wind from that wavy main 	b
1141	I never thought to see again. 	b
1142	Bless thee, bright Sea, and glorious dome, 	b
1143	And thinks he of Patrician pride, 	b
1144	My voice is choked, but not with grief, 	b
1145	Bright, but yet sullied, love which could never 	b
1146	I know my mountain breezes 	b
1147	Deepened the gloom of evening's sky, 	b
1148	And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold 	b
1149	The long grass bending where I lay, 	b
1150	And in the heath or mountain far 	b
1151	The goats fly by with timid cry, 	b
1152	His golden days left long behind. 	b
1153	But then it was a calmer woe, 	b
1154	'Tis many a year, 'tis long ago, 	b
1155	A dream of what had been before j 	b
1156	Was that in which the summer sheen 	b
1157	Ungoverned nature madly spurned 	b
1158	Memory of feelings past, 	b
1159	Often I 've sat down on the ground, 	b
1160	Gazing up to the flush scarce seen, 	b
1161	Those bounding breasts that grief should thrill 	b
1162	Then died away, nor came again ; 	b
1163	Thy deep, unutterable woe? 	b
1164	But my sad heart must ever mourn 	b
1165	It sought thy father's home and mine 	b
1166	As I remembered it of old. 	b
1167	And dreamy scents of fragrance pass 	b
1168	Come back the feelings that would swell, 	b
1169	FAR away is the land of rest 	b
1170	They would have done it had they known 	b
1171	Oh ! I shall weary for the light 	b
1172	I howled, and tore my tangled hair ; 	b
1173	Time has turned the bloom to grey, 	b
1174	Lay in unspeakable despair. 	b
1175	of New York in 1902. 	b
1176	Then 'twas first my nursling smiled ; 	b
1177	But both without a murmur there 	b
1178	But her father smiled on the fairest child 	b
1179	WHAT winter floods, what streams of spring 	b
1180	winds coldly mourn 	b
1181	Dead, dead is my joy, 	b
1182	Might embrace in love again ; 	b
1183	To see that water shine ; 	b
1184	But sighing it murmurs, * Let memory perish, 	b
1185	IN the same place, when nature wore 	b
1186	And nothing on the summer gale 	b
1187	The dearest to a mountaineer 	b
1188	For, if your former words were true, 	b
1189	I cannot say my faith is strong, 	b
1190	Now might we doubt God's guardian 	b
1191	Those wondrous southern Isles to hail, 	b
1192	Behold he sinks away ! 	b
1193	LORD of Elbe, on Elbe hill 	b
1194	The mist is thick and the wind is chill ; 	b
1195	More wakeful heart and eyelids grew. 	b
1196	Has sighed for sorrow that thou wert away. 	b
1197	And in his hair the south wind blows, 	b
1198	And hopeless comes its dark decline, 	b
1199	Oh, we are listening for a sound, 	b
1200	Moans as the night gusts over it blow. 	b
1201	Till each far-down reflection is 	b
1202	I see them far off, and it deepens the gloom ; 	b
1203	An undefined, an awful dream, 	b
1204	Where chill, chill whiteness covered all, 	b
1205	In unexhausted woe. 	b
1206	In darkness long concealed, 	b
1207	Would now be tossing under me. 	b
1208	I will not question, only say 	b
1209	But thou art now on the desolate sea, 	b
1210	Regive him shadowy gleams of infancy 	b
1211	Of love too warm, and wild, and bright. 	b
1212	The Herons are flown to their trees by the Hall ; 	b
1213	COLD, clear, and blue the morning heaven 	b
1214	Will give me to a darker doom ; 	b
1215	Through a sky of cloudy grey. 	b
1216	Reflects that winter sky : 	b
1217	In glimpses of a spirit shore 	b
1218	A silent, silvery star. 	b
1219	And I have long forgot to weep. 	b
1220	Sweetly has its dawn begun ; 	b
1221	But the heaven may shake with thunder 	b
1222	Himself restored to infancy? 	b
1223	To leave my lonely halls ! ' 	b
1224	Bless thee, bless all I cannot speak ; 	b
1225	For the moon now beaming mild above 	b
1226	Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave 	b
1227	From that wide heaven where every star 	b
1228	IF grief for grief can touch thee, 	b
1229	One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings 	b
1230	Within their perfumed bower, 	b
1231	Of sorrows gathering near, 	b
1232	From her stately form and her features rare, 	b
1233	And young leaves shoot among the fern. 	b
1234	The twilight fading from the skies, 	b
1235	What ! shall they carve on his tomb with the sword 	b
1236	How thou didst turn in mockery 	b
1237	Sparkling in sunshine and in dew, 	b
1238	Had its waters worn the shore. 	b
1239	Methinks the mellowing haze of years 	b
1240	No doubt had marr'd my word ; 	b
1241	TELL me, tell me, smiling child, 	b
1242	What the past is like to thee? 	b
1243	As glancing o'er the moorland track, 	b
1244	Something in that ancestral pride 	b
1245	Tell me what is the present hour? 	b
1246	A green and flowery spray, 	b
1247	Where a young bird sits gathering its power 	b
1248	Your cold hands hardly hold the weary pen : 	b
1249	And what is the future, happy one? 	b
1250	Sunk to peace the twilight breeze : 	b
1251	A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea, 	b
1252	Stretching into infinity. 	b
1253	The inspiring music's thrilling sound, 	b
1254	No, Earth would wish no other sphere 	b
1255	The glittering splendour rising round, 	b
1256	Yet of the native shepherds none, 	b
1257	So stilly round the evening falls ; 	b
1258	To keep my honour fair ; 	b
1259	Covering her brow to hide the tear 	b
1260	The shepherd placed a seat and pressed 	b
1261	From it the torrents flow ? 	b
1262	Never put back that golden flow 	b
1263	That murmur to the breezes' call 	b
1264	The laden bee flew home, 	b
1265	And raised the covering from his brow, 	b
1266	* Nay, call me not ; it may not be ; 	b
1267	Still spoke to me of years gone by ; 	b
1268	Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending ; 	b
1269	Man's spirit away from the drear dungeon sending, 	b
1270	And sound and sight had well combined 	b
1271	All down the mountain-sides wild forests lending 	b
1272	The mighty voice to the life-giving wind ; 	b
1273	With dying torments riven 	b
1274	Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 	b
1275	The withering corpse to me. 	b
1276	The busy day has glided by, 	b
1277	For not through age, and not through crime, 	b
1278	Of the golden-gifted time ; 	b
1279	And, Douglas ! thou shalt be 	b
1280	When my sad soul forgot its pride 	b
1281	Since cast from off thine angel brow 	b
1282	Woods, you need not frown on me ; 	b
1283	I have suffered on thro' night and day ; 	b
1284	To know where she is laid. 	b
1285	You need not mock so bitterly. 	b
1286	Thy silvery form, so soft and fair, 	b
1287	I watched how evening took the place 	b
1288	And, far away, down Elmor scars 	b
1289	* The birds that now so blithely sing, 	b
1290	And warms the breezy air. 	b
1291	The waste of youth, the waste of years, 	b
1292	COME walk with me, 	b
1293	And still the words and still the tone 	b
1294	I dream of moor, and misty hill, 	b
1295	In all the hours of gloom 	b
1296	Will find a heart to bear. 	b
1297	WELL narrower draw the circle round, 	b
1298	Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair. 	b
1299	Through the long nights of angry weather, 	b
1300	When parted ghosts might come, 	b
1301	Above their prisoned dust to grieve 	b
1302	Its twilight hours and evenings dark 	b
1303	Whose waves are foaming far and wide. 	b
1304	One gush of ardent prayer. 	b
1305	Forget the hopes of years : 	b
1306	With the radiant red of furnace flames 	b
1307	Senselessly has lain. 	b
1308	To the discord of lute-strings all unstrung. 	b
1309	My robes, and smooth my tangled hair ; 	b
1310	And constant sorrow on my brow 	b
1311	The saints shall shelter thee from harm. 	b
1312	And spread with smiles the evening meal ; 	b
1313	In years by time long left behind ; 	b
1314	TO A WREATH OF SNOW 	b
1315	When I began to pray. 	b
1316	And still it bent above, 	b
1317	They come sailing on, 	b
1318	How oft have I forgot my God, 	b
1319	Yet my heart loves December's smile 	b
1320	That tracks the boundless blue. 	b
1321	Paints her image on the mind. 	b
1322	Of gazing in thine eyes. 	b
1323	And think the fearful vision o'er. 	b
1324	The blossoms to deck my home with the dead. 	b
1325	Tis like the heaven which parting days 	b
1326	The idol chiefs of all. 	b
1327	As if grown weary of the light 	b
1328	When its lips opened and a sound 	b
1329	Awoke the stillness reigning round, 	b
1330	Faint as a dream, but the earth shrank, 	b
1331	And truly like a god she seems, 	b
1332	Woe for the day ! Regina's pride, 	b
1333	Retracing back her lifetime flown ; 	b
1334	And thus in strange response he spoke. 	b
1335	The circling hills to kiss. 	b
1336	Where fairer forms in darkness lie ; 	b
1337	That time is treasuring up for me. 	b
1338	Sound through the granite glen ; 	b
1339	All vague and undefined ? 	b
1340	That sad lament was ringing ; 	b
1341	Twill break for thee. 	b
1342	Such dreamy, dreary singing. 	b
1343	Aware her last hour approaching fast, 	b
1344	Of mirror broken on the grass, 	b
1345	Watch for a bird with sable wing, 	b
1346	And weaker minds would fear. 	b
1347	I listened to thy mournful sighing. 	b
1348	Were by a faint breeze blown ; 	b
1349	I knew the source whence sprung those tears 	b
1350	They raise their eyes, for the sunny skies 	b
1351	Reveal ; where o'er a lone green wood 	b
1352	How well my spirit knows the path 	b
1353	Was given me in that silent hour 	b
1354	In a yeoman's home-close grew ; 	b
1355	In cell and cloister drear ; 	b
1356	At last the sunshine left the ground, 	b
1357	The bright blue flowers and velvet sod, 	b
1358	Were strange conductors to the bowers 	b
1359	I need not fear my foes, 	b
1360	Aid for that which lies before. 	b
1361	In a grave that never shuts its dead 	b
1362	Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 	b
1363	In cloudy morning clothed the sky. 	b
1364	Come, sit down on this sunny stone ; 	b
1365	I saw His wisdom infinite, 	b
1366	In her uncovered eye ; 	b
1367	But beneath the earth is midnight 	b
1368	Waiting to hear the lingering feet 	b
1369	And whistles round the gloomy wall, 	b
1370	And lingering long, and thinking grieves, 	b
1371	How it longed how it burned to be free ! 	b
1372	And no one laughed, and none seemed free from 	b
1373	He wakens, and how ghastly white 	b
1374	By whom all things were made ; 	b
1375	So, resting on a heathy bank, 	b
1376	And will sustain when thou art gone. 	b
1377	me mourn ; 	b
1378	An anguish in his bosom now ; 	b
1379	COMPANIONS all day long we 've stood 	b
1380	Fixed strainedly on the vacant air ; 	b
1381	His wisdom so divine, 	b
1382	Weak, wretched sinner though I be, 	b
1383	Sleeping silently and still, 	b
1384	On Eversham's woody brow. 	b
1385	That living, is not nobler now 	b
1386	Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow ; 	b
1387	To see the sunshine disappear ; 	b
1388	The breeze sings like a summer breeze 	b
1389	Then silent weep J cannot weep, 	b
1390	Cut off from hope in early day, 	b
1391	From earth and glory cut away. 	b
1392	That haunts his feudal home ; 	b
1393	Must image forth the scowl of night, 	b
1394	And childhood's flower must waste its bloom 	b
1395	Beneath the shadow of the tomb. 	b
1396	Though vengeance held a sheathed sword 	b
1397	And still did evening fall ; 	b
1398	Through infinite immensity. 	b
1399	Wave gently round her head. 	b
1400	Tells what once those features were, 	b
1401	By that celestial shine I 	b
1402	And the dying their last watch were keeping 	b
1403	Let us be laid in lasting rest, 	b
1404	Lost their robes of tender green ? 	b
1405	That I should greet approaching feet, 	b
1406	Half the sweet, the haunting smile ; 	b
1407	Other desires and other hopes beset me, 	b
1408	There is a voice in the wind that waves 	b
1409	And pleasure tune its chords again. 	b
1410	And my eyes cannot hold the tears 	b
1411	Was it some feeling of delight, 	b
1412	From the time of morning's earliest dew 	b
1413	Blasts with that oath his perjured soul, 	b
1414	Kindle a short and bitter smile, 	b
1415	The sun of evening died, 	b
1416	Sleep, stilly sleep, thou bright-haired child, 	b
1417	Its large dark eyes of shadowy light, 	b
1418	Waveless and calm lies that silent deep 	b
1419	They fleck with shade our mountains bright 	b
1420	A little longer in this reverie : 	b
1421	Upon its heathy shores. 	b
1422	But not a dream of sleep ; 	b
1423	Ah ! could my hand unlock its chain, 	b
1424	Were off like light again. 	b
1425	For every torturing tear. 	b
1426	And chained was every tongue. 	b
1427	To mourn o'er what I mourn. 	b
1428	God ! bless her sun with victory, 	b
1429	In some warm nook a couch to find. 	b
1430	strong and far : 	b
1431	Fluttering from the autumn tree. 	b
1432	That through the shadows shone 	b
1433	The languid lid would close, 	b
1434	Though I no more may watchful bend 	b
1435	Through dreams where startling imagery 	b
1436	Can no memory now recall 	b
1437	Home to their journey's end ; 	b
1438	ALONE I sat ; the summer day 	b
1439	Had died in smiling light away ; 	b
1440	Returning to my breast again. 	b
1441	For past misery are we weeping? 	b
1442	I will sail the desert sea. 	b
1443	Roams in the dawn of day ; 	b
1444	The harvest-moon looks down ; 	b
1445	Look on those woods, look on that mountain lorn, 	b
1446	I '11 hide it in my heart no more, 	b
1447	Then why is all so sad and lone? 	b
1448	How invincible its roar, 	b
1449	A shattered wreck on ocean's tide, 	b
1450	But that at Ambition's bidding, 	b
1451	The heart so long endeared to thee, 	b
1452	Are you a hawk to follow the prey, 	b
1453	Till death shall sound his signal cry, 	b
1454	Visions by ardent fancy fed 	b
1455	And yet a dreamlike comfort came 	b
1456	But now, when I had hoped to sing, 	b
1457	My fingers strike a tuneless string ; 	b
1458	Who bound us in one vigorous whole 	b
1459	Still clung she to his bridle rein 	b
1460	Yet have I read these falcon eyes, 	b
1461	He faintly prayed, < O Death, delay 	b
1462	But a tyrant spell has bound me, 	b
1463	'Tis like old age pretending 	b
1464	Roofless, crumbling to the ground ; 	b
1465	Their bare boughs weighed with snow, 	b
1466	We both together struck the blow ; 	b
1467	And yet I cannot go. 	b
1468	OH, all the cares these noontide airs 	b
1469	Wastes beyond wastes below ; 	b
1470	When the sun first crowned the hill, 	b
1471	Beneath these sullen skies? 	b
1472	I 'LL come when thou art saddest, 	b
1473	Bring light to the darkened room, 	b
1474	When the rude day's mirth has vanished, 	b
1475	Spirit of bliss ! what brings thee here, 	b
1476	Long he gazed and held his breath, 	b
1477	I '11 come when the heart's worst feeling 	b
1478	Has entire, unbiassed sway, 	b
1479	But some I read so well, 	b
1480	And gives to fancy magic power 	b
1481	It was a summer day that saw 	b
1482	Listen ! 'tis just the hour, 	b
1483	But who reads not through the tender glow 	b
1484	But thank your passion not for me ! 	b
1485	A flood of strange sensations roll, 	b
1486	Forerunners of a sterner power, 	b
1487	Heralds of me? 	b
1488	THE soft unclouded blue of air, 	b
1489	Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke 	b
1490	How daredst thou wake thoughts in me, 	b
1491	And lived upon this weary Earth 	b
1492	But then I knew that he stood free, 	b
1493	Was it the smile of early spring 	b
1494	And then I felt . . . \unfinished\. 	b
1495	Now trust a heart that trusts in you, 	b
1496	Douglas leaned above the well ; 	b
1497	And may not be forgiven. 	b
1498	My heart is with your heart at home ; 	b
1499	cold, cold is my heart ! 	b
1500	We both were scorned, both sternly driven 	b
1501	Over his own unhappy soul ; 	b
1502	Unless I change in every thought, 	b
1503	And memory will restore me nought, 	b
1504	Look now she rests below, 	b
1505	The clouds are earthward yearning ; 	b
1506	The smothering snow-clouds rolled away ; 	b
1507	The barren mountain-side lies bare, 	b
1508	He would not give one moorland wild 	b
1509	As shines earth's sun in summer noon 	b
1510	And whiter brows than yours may be, 	b
1511	Where city walls spread wide around 	b
1512	And lightning looks from orbs divine 	b
1513	About my pathway burn and shine. 	b
1514	But that pure light, changeless and strong, 	b
1515	That last dim beam that sets for thee, 	b
1516	Echoing to their bells. 	b
1517	My feeble faith still clings to Thee. 	b
1518	When we were wont to burst away 	b
1519	Remembrance never dies, 	b
1520	From hope, and peace, and power, and 	b
1521	Her former life's eventful day 	b
1522	Know nought akin to our despair ; 	b
1523	Without a voice to speak to you 	b
1524	For that mist may break when the sun is high, 	b
1525	For bygone griefs and dried-up tears. 	b
1526	In open day and cheerful sun, 	b
1527	Lord Lesley, let it free ; 	b
1528	Waiting the death that was to come. 	b
1529	On which it ought to wend. 	b
1530	Sleep brings no strength to me, 	b
1531	Must claim from Justice lasting rest ; 	b
1532	Youth's warm affections gave, 	b
1533	To meet its early tomb ? 	b
1534	Mad though that anguish be, 	b
1535	As warm as middle June. 	b
1536	And yet it seems a dreary moor, 	b
1537	Was heavier far than earth can be ; 	b
1538	A shelter from the sky. 	b
1539	And never Fejian devotee 	b
1540	My only wish is to forget 	b
1541	In endless sleep of death. 	b
1542	Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes ; 	b
1543	Had they but seen their idol then, 	b
1544	Strong I stand, and laugh to see 	b
1545	That leaf from its parent tree ; 	b
1546	Shut out from joy and liberty, 	b
1547	All the puny ways of men ; 	b
1548	The first to fight, the last to fall, 	b
1549	Then come again ; thou wilt not shrink 	b
1550	The glory of the festal day, 	b
1551	Ought for a moment to be mine : 	b
1552	Affrightened from that ceaseless roar. 	b
1553	Beneath its mighty glare : 	b
1554	Thing of Dust, with boundless pride, 	b
1555	Dare you ask me for a guide ? 	b
1556	Will hardly let her gleam, 	b
1557	Or any, but an exile's doom. 	b
1558	Windows through whose broken panes the night- 	b
1559	To free the world from tyrant's chain, 	b
1560	For which we fought and bled and died. 	b
1561	I saw her give th' unanswered kiss 	b
1562	Full soon divided him from me. 	b
1563	Where their bright glories shone at first. 	b
1564	To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven ; 	b
1565	Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife, 	b
1566	That should startle the nations that rest around. 	b
1567	What pleasant airs upon her face 	b
1568	Confused and strange and drear. 	b
1569	She sits and fondly seems to trace 	b
1570	And never more at early dawning 	b
1571	And I must see the final gloom 	b
1572	The accursed man shall be ; 	b
1573	Dear childhood's innocence forgive, 	b
1574	And my eye can wander through worlds of light. 	b
1575	Methinks their chime sounds faint and drear, 	b
1576	My lids closed down, yet through their veil 	b
1577	The glory of a summer sky. 	b
1578	And form my mood to Nature's mood. 	b
1579	The tiny ripples flame. 	b
1580	Went, and ne'er returned again ! 	b
1581	I cannot bear to go away. 	b
1582	May beam the blaze of July's sun, 	b
1583	To soothe your grief or calm your care ; 	b
1584	Nay, do not weep ; that bitter mourning 	b
1585	And man's remarks or sighs or scorn, 	b
1586	Full many a heart, that in the tomb, 	b
1587	For ever dark, for ever cold. 	b
1588	You '11 dry your tears and check your sighing, 	b
1589	Lie low and lone the silent dead ; 	b
1590	FALL, leaves, fall ; die, flowers, away ; 	b
1591	If I were quite alone, 	b
1592	One ripple in the lovely lake ; 	b
1593	Lost, cursed, degraded all for thee ! 	b
1594	There are bones whitening there in the 	b
1595	Fernando left his home and you, 	b
1596	And still I think you must remember 	b
1597	Marking my despondency. 	b
1598	Lit by the evening flame, 	b
1599	I longed to see his face again, 	b
1600	From his daylong dream at once he woke ; 	b
1601	Better that I my own fate mourning, 	b
1602	Except for you, my dearest queen ! 	b
1603	There lies a lone and lovely glade, 	b
1604	And there the hearts together nourished, 	b
1605	Since parted from thee I am left alone, 	b
1606	The afternoon in softened glory 	b
1607	In the old church beneath the stone, 	b
1608	And the broad park spread before me 	b
1609	And curse instead of pray. 	b
1610	And there I stood when he had left me, 	b
1611	With ashy cheek and tearless eye, 	b
1612	Watching the ship whose sail bereft me 	b
1613	In gathering gloom in every glade, 	b
1614	By the wild storm blasts roughly broke, 	b
1615	O may I never lose the peace 	b
1616	My soul still bounded o'er the billow, 	b
1617	The curtains waved, the wakened flies 	b
1618	The azure flowers where they were nursed, 	b
1619	One brief glimpse to thine eye, I 	b
1620	Its much-desired repose. 	b
1621	Of safe deliverance from the sea. 	b
1622	Yet, alas ! the sooner turning 	b
1623	And drowned my bloom of youth in tears. 	b
1624	And time at length brought power for coping 	b
1625	With thoughts I could not once endure. 	b
1626	MAY flowers are opening, 	b
1627	The place that saw our last farewell, 	b
1628	Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe, 	b
1629	In plundered churches piled with dead 	b
1630	Go out upon the breezy moor ; 	b
1631	AWAKE, awake ! how loud the stormy morning 	b
1632	Calls up to life the nation's resting round ; 	b
1633	What follows in Ula's garden sweet 	b
1634	And violet and wild woodrose 	b
1635	One whisper, one sweet dream in him, 	b
1636	' Twill only yield another sight 	b
1637	That while the world was lost to her 	b
1638	A beam of glory there, 	b
1639	It was cultured by another hand, 	b
1640	A traitor's perjury. 	b
1641	And her look of Majesty. 	b
1642	The sea-green standard lies in dust beneath. 	b
1643	To which my own was given ; 	b
1644	Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free ; 	b
1645	It was just the time of eve, 	b
1646	Let me remember half the woes 	b
1647	Are but the shattered glass 	b
1648	Can still the spirit's storm ; 	b
1649	While thou canst speak with such a tone ! 	b
1650	But how can I live lonely here? 	b
1651	From turret, tower and wall. 	b
1652	And prone to every sin ; 	b
1653	And in the haze of glorious light 	b
1654	I have sat lonely all the day, 	b
1655	In the pure light of childhood's morn, 	b
1656	Where blackbird and the throstle dwell ; 	b
1657	Save that deep gong which tolled my 	b
1658	A thousand strains of Music swell. 	b
1659	For God alone doth know how blessed 	b
1660	And every listener swears it true ; 	b
1661	And tell me, why such blessed sleep 	b
1662	Unlike the bloom I like to see. 	b
1663	So full of soul, so deeply sweet ; 	b
1664	The grave must close those limbs around, 	b
1665	The moonbeam and the storm, 	b
1666	While the wind is whispering only, 	b
1667	Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim. 	b
1668	How can I break these iron chains, 	b
1669	Are the hours to come, the joyless hours, 	b
1670	With beams of such impartial blaze, 	b
1671	It chained the snow-swollen streams no more. 	b
1672	And they will reach it soon. 	b
1673	And then a sudden flash of flame, 	b
1674	And leave my human feelings 	b
1675	Into my heart and anxious eye, 	b
1676	Then his eyes began to weary, 	b
1677	Amid the howling storm of war? 	b
1678	care and tears and pain. 	b
1679	But coldly breaks November's day ; 	b
1680	But hate eternally. 1 	b
1681	Eldenna's waves are rolling red, 	b
1682	Shade of history, I condemn 	b
1683	If my spirit's eye can see, 	b
1684	And deeper green is on the hill. 	b
1685	I looked out to see her there, 	b
1686	They all are held in me ; 	b
1687	And all seem glad their voice to hear ; 	b
1688	Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting ; 	b
1689	A tear might flow, ay, many a tear, 	b
1690	And there in those wild bowers 	b
1691	No whisper, not to me ; 	b
1692	I could not sleep through that wild siege, 	b
1693	I know that I have done thee wrong, 	b
1694	And mourned a love for ever flown. 	b
1695	Sank back again to childhood's day ; 	b
1696	Its cheering smile to see, 	b
1697	That sin was purified by woe. 	b
1698	Your worlds of solemn light, again, 	b
1699	To us, in unimagined bloom, 	b
1700	And she springs up in haste to greet 	b
1701	And thou art near thy prime? 	b
1702	It was a pleasant April day 	b
1703	So I knew that he was dying 	b
1704	Watching the drizzly mist descend, 	b
1705	Descend like rain upon the heath. 	b
1706	Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares. 	b
1707	Held by the mountain men. 	b
1708	Like bandit-knife was hung. 	b
1709	And what shall change that angel brow, 	b
1710	To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region ; 	b
1711	Laid on the grass I lapsed away, 	b
1712	Blend with a song of troubled times. 	b
1713	To seize the falling rein. 	b
1714	Thus thy first hour's course shall be : 	b
1715	With voice subdued and steady look, 	b
1716	Spring grass grows green and fair ; 	b
1717	Call Death yes Death he is mine own, 	b
1718	To live in every sweetest thought ; 	b
1719	And sweeter than a flute's reply 	b
1720	Where royal corpses lay. 	b
1721	And there was eastern incense burnt, 	b
1722	For sun, before they close, 	b
1723	In mercy launch one arrow more ; 	b
1724	With sacred halos round it shed ? 	b
1725	But death has stolen our company, 	b
1726	And words upon the breezes hung. 	b
1727	Its sufferings and its tears. 	b
1728	' Bless it ! My gracious God ! ' I cried. 	b
1729	Welcome at last, though once so drear. 	b
1730	Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish 	b
1731	Shall our feet forget the way ? 	b
1732	Vainly would man divine or tell. 	b
1733	STRONG I stand, though I have borne 	b
1734	Look how in sable gloom 	b
1735	A darker wave. 	b
1736	Glows o'er the graves of Elrington, 	b
1737	It was about the middle night 	b
1738	So their fond hearts were free, 	b
1739	The shallow wrecks of memories 	b
1740	Looks down on the descending sun ; 	b
1741	Thou art my intimate delight, 	b
1742	Deep secrets of His Providence 	b
1743	It pines in cold captivity, 	b
1744	One penance tender tears. 	b
1745	HINDER me by no delay ! 	b
1746	He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn. 	b
1747	Yonder they stand and watch the waves 	b
1748	What have I now? The star that brightly 	b
1749	Dry thine eyes, too ; 'tis vain to keep 	b
1750	HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES 	b
1751	Now seems as nothing in the single cloud 	b
1752	That laid my best affections low, 	b
1753	That thou wouldst call to mind. 	b
1754	And yet, a king, though Prudence well 	b
1755	My horse had strayed, I cannot say ; 	b
1756	Zamorna is this nobly done, 	b
1757	But could the day seem dark to me 	b
1758	Those tones were softer than the moan 	b
1759	Has passed from summer's heaven divine, 	b
1760	I ask for nothing further here 	b
1761	From the side of the wintry brae. 	b
1762	I should not be if that were gone 	b
1763	YES, holy be thy resting-place 	b
1764	THROUGH the hours of yesternight 	b
1765	She murmured with a sigh. 	b
1766	And nations round are fearing, 	b
1767	So humbly by her side ; 	b
1768	That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my 	b
1769	An icy glory caught mine eye, 	b
1770	O come away ! The Norman door 	b
1771	And my glad heart bound wilder still. 	b
1772	From his heart's fountain swell, 	b
1773	My hour of rest had fleeted by, 	b
1774	Toss up the window's velvet veil, 	b
1775	What is past can hurt no more ; 	b
1776	To sit within this Norman door, 	b
1777	No : that I feel can never be ; 	b
1778	* Angora's hills have heard their tread, 	b
1779	* Well, thou hast fought for many a year, 	b
1780	Like youth, to my maturer eyes, 	b
1781	She sees us, sister, now ; 	b
1782	And I have sat and watched the trees, 	b
1783	Their glory-haloed crown to wear. 	b
1784	And merry words to whispers die, 	b
1785	Whose forms have troubled me, 	b
1786	The woods and fields and golden flowers 	b
1787	That we must bind thee down and clench thy 	b
1788	Is welcome as a friend ; 	b
1789	Though earth and man were gone, 	b
1790	False and foolish mortal know, 	b
1791	I 've trod a dark and frightful way. 	b
1792	As kindly as the good. 	b
1793	The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold ; 	b
1794	Though not for fear, though not for shame. 	b

1799	And the crags where I wandered of old. 	b

1802	Then why lament that those we love 	b
1803	And wild birds bursting from their songless nest, 	b
1804	But yet it was a glorious sun, 	b
1805	When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes 	b
1806	What my soul bore, my soul alone 	b
1807	Have studied long their glance and feel 	b
1808	And all my prospect of relief 	b
1809	His heart is stirred through all its strings, 	b
1810	And then a wakening from above ; 	b
1811	As it tossed against the heaven, 	b
