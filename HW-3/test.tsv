1	From fairest creatures we desire increase,	s
2	With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	s
3	His tender heir might bear his memory:	s
4	But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	s
5	Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	s
6	Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	s
7	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	s
8	And only herald to the gaudy spring,	s
9	Within thine own bud buriest thy content	s
10	And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	s
11	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	s
12	To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	s
13	When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	s
14	Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,	s
15	Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	s
16	Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	s
17	Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	s
18	Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	s
19	To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	s
20	Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	s
